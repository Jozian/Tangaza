To create a deb of Tangaza, you need to run make-tangaza-deb.sh

The following variables have to be correctly set BEFORE you run it.
They should point to the location of the local Tangaza and Common 
git repositories.

 - TANGAZA_SCRIPTS=/path/to/git/Tangaza
 - COMMON_SCRIPTS=/path/to/git/Common

THe build process uses debhelper utility to generate the deb package.
You therefore have to install the necessary packages for the builder
to work.
Use the command below:

sudo apt-get install dh-make devscripts build-essential wget fakeroot liburi-perl debhelper pbuilder

The generated deb file will be saved in "install/tangaza-*.deb".
You should then run install/install.sh to install tangaza-*.deb.
