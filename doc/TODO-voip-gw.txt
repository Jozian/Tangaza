Changes from standard package to get GSM-VoIP gateway to work

Install asterisk v10
dpkg -r --ignore-depends=tangaza asterisk
download asterisk source, ./configure, make, make install
no additional asterisk config needed

Fix web site
The apache install from the package appears to be broken.
sudo cp debian/tangaza/etc/tangaza/tangaza-sms /etc/apache2/sites-available/

Goal:
- Show UI (web, text, ivr) using gateway
- Create poster that shows steps
  - what (benefit to NGOs), how, results (DEV trial, upcoming)
Steps:
+ compile Asterisk 10
  - need to tell it to permanently ignore package 'asterisk'
  + dpkg -i --ignore-depends=asterisk tangaza_1.0-1_all.deb
- Gateway setup
  + update firmware
  + Number in slot 1: 617-909-4893

  - because we are running in a VM, needed to set VM's network
    connection to be direct and to explicitly use ethernet (which is
    connected to gateway).  The gateway gave it an address of
    192.168.8.101.  In GW "call settings" used this address instead of
    as wiki says.

  - Leaving off:
    permanently ignore package 'asterisk'
    recompile asterisk with sip support
    Leave time to prep for Mikko meeting

- fix web side
  - not working; filed bug
+ starting up daemons by hand
  + sudo -u asterisk perl -w -I /usr/share/tangaza/agi-bin
    /usr/share/tangaza/agi-bin/tangaza.agi (does not work as-is b/c
    ast use needs right env variables)

+ decide where to put gsm gw config
  + /usr/tangaza/settings.conf

- disable kannel and maybe sms-send-daemon
  + don't see how to disable kannel without changing config file,
  which seems a no-no
  - switch off sms-send-daemon in /etc/init.d/tangaza

- see how to send sms from within perl
  + are any sms sent not from within Ast connection, ie do we need to
  use call files / daemon? Answer: no
  + grep for sms in Nokia::Tangaza and Common.  It looks like the only
    two sms outgoing are in Entry and Update.  These can instead use
    Tool's sms_enqueue, which can send the msg directly via Asterisk.
  - test change to Entry where removed direct call to smsqueue
  - test Tools.pm sms_enqueue

- Send incoming SMS to django

- add extension.conf to use sip.conf (and sip.conf)
