Changes from standard package to get GSM-VoIP gateway to work

Install asterisk v10
dpkg -r --ignore-depends=tangaza asterisk
download asterisk source, ./configure, make, make install
no additional asterisk config needed

Fix web site
The apache install from the package appears to be broken.
sudo cp debian/tangaza/etc/tangaza/tangaza-sms /etc/apache2/sites-available/

Goal:
- Show UI (web, text, ivr) using gateway
- Create poster that shows steps
  - what (benefit to NGOs), how, results (DEV trial, upcoming)
Steps:
+ compile Asterisk 10
  - need to tell it to permanently ignore package 'asterisk'
- set up to same point as Tangaza wiki on gw
  - dpkg -i --ignore-depends=asterisk tangaza_1.0-1_all.deb
- fix web side
  - not working; filed bug
+ starting up daemons by hand
  - sudo -u asterisk perl -w /usr/share/tangaza/agi-bin/tangaza.agi

- decide where to put gsm gw config
- disable kannel and maybe sms-send-daemon
- see how to send sms from within perl
  - are any sms sent not from within Ast connection, ie do we need to
  use call files / daemon?
- add extension.conf to use sip.conf (and sip.conf)
